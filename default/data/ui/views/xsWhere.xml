                                        a semantic query. An event is compatible with the query if
                                        the compatibility index (xcix) is greater than the alfacut.
                                        The default alfacut is 0.2. If an event meets this
                                        condition, it is written to the output stream with the value
                                        of the xcix added as a field named by cixname. The default
                                        is "WhereCIX". If not, the event is disposed. The xcix is
                                        generated using one of two functions, avg or weighted. The
                                        avg function sums the membership values of each query and
                                        divides by the count. The weighted function is similar to a
                                        weighted average. The xcix is calculated by putting a higher
                                        value on memberhip in terms that are closer to the beginning
                                        of the query, and then divides by the weighted count. Since
                                        the xcix is added to each event that meets the alfacut,
                                        other commands can then be applied to generate more
                                        intelligent information.</span>
