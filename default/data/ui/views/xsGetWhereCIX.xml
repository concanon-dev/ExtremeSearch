                                        with a semantic query. Each event is written to the output
                                        stream with the compatibility value (xcix) added as a field
                                        named by cixname. The default is "WhereCIX". The xcix is
                                        generated using one of two functions, avg or weighted. The
                                        avg function sums the membership values of eah query and
                                        divides by the count. The weighted function is similar to a
                                        weighted average. The xcix is calculated by putting a higher
                                        value on memberhip in semantic terms that are closer to the
                                        beginning of the query, and then divides by the weighted
                                        count. Since the xcix is added to each event, other commands
                                        can then be applied to generate more intelligent
                                        information.</span>
