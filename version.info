command resides in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/xtreme/bin.  This program must be run from 
the command line as follows:

$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/xtreme/bin/xsconvert <oldContext> <newContext>

The names of the contexts may be the same.

This command should be run in each contexts directory found in $SPLUNK_HOME on each Search Head, unless they are pooled.
